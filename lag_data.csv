A mixture of CF and CTA in molar ratios of 4:1(1.496 g:0.370 g), 3:1 (1.423 g:0.469 g), 2:1 (1.296 g:0.642 g), 1:1 (1.023 g:1.012 g), 1:2 (0.720 g:1.424 g), 1:3 (0.556 g:1.647 g), and 1:4 (0.452 g:1.788 g) with stainless steel balls was performed in a 45-mL stainless steel jar. The LAG experiments were carried out under two experimental conditions: (I) using 12 stainless steel balls with diameters of 9.5 mm and 20 stainless steel balls with diameters of 6.35 mm and (II) using 40 stainless steel balls with diameters of 6.35 mm. Then, 0.30 mL of distilled water was added to the jar. The revolu- tion speed of the jar N (rpm) and the grinding time t (min) were varied as the main variables. In addition, the jar itself was rotated in the opposite direction to the revolution at the rate of N. The grinding time was considered as the accumulated time. The grind- ing process was stopped every 10 min to cool the jar for 10 min to prevent an excessive increase in temperature during the grinding process (Kim et al., 2004). The ground samples were stored at room temperature with silica gel until further analysis."

Two different mills were used for the preparations, with no perceivable differences in the results: a Retsch MM 200 mill with two 10 mL vessels of stainless steel and a Fritsch Pulverisette 23 with a 5 mL grinding bowl. Three spheres of stainless steel of about 5 mm of width were added in the reactors on all the preparations. As first approach, the reagents were mixed in equimolar proportions. However, we soon realized that the stoichiometry of compound 1 was not equimolar, because the obtained cocrystal product was the actual 2:1 proportion mixed with an excess of 4-aminosalicylic acid. Any attempts to prepare the theophylline...4-aminosalicylic acid (1:1) or theophylline...4-aminobenzoic acid (2:1) cocrystals, resulted in physical mixtures of compounds 1 and 2 with the respective reagent in excess (See figures S2 and S3 for details)

The resultant cocrystals were dried overnight at ambient temperature, passed through 60 mesh sieve and stored in air tight container until use.

30 μL of methanol in a 10 mL stainless steel jar with one 15 mm stainless
steel grinding ball. The mixture was ground for 25 min at a frequency of
40 Hz."

and salicylic acid were added in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to an agate mortar. Liquid-assisted grinding with a few drops of water was performed
for 40 min to obtain andrographolide-salicylic acid cocrystals."

mL centrifuge tube, along with two 3.0 mm diameter zirconia pellets and
a small quantity of anhydrous ethanol (10 μL). The tube was then
inserted into a 48-channel high-throughput ball mill and grounded at 20
Hz at room temperature for 60 min. After grinding and drying, the
resulting solid powders were obtained, identified as DAI-4VDP cocrystal
powder or DAI-4EDP cocrystal powder."

(approximately 100 μL) to improve cocrystallization kinetics. All formulations
were investigated in a molar ratio of 1:0.5, and 1:1 for the
drug and coformers, respectively. The collected material was dried
overnight in a laboratory oven at 40 ◦C to remove any trace amount of
solvent before further characterization."
